# NCKU-VSD
**This repo is using backup my VSD HW.**
  Proj1 is writting a five stages pipeline cpu, in my design, my branch address will be detect in ID stage not in EX stage, can reduce the flush effort, but cause the ID stage critical path more long, total execution time turn higher.
  Proj2 is origin CPU connecting to AXI protocol, in this project, writting the arbiter, AXI and AXI wrapper first time.
  Proj3 is following preivous work, added cache in our CPU, because cache is inside CPU, for increase total performance, reduce data access memory time.
  Proj4 is following preivous work, added CSR instructions, CSR registers, interrupt control, DRAM wrapper and ROM wrapper.
  Proj5 is total put their togather, and added a new IP is JPEG decoder, but not do well, so no put it on github.
